The attach file is the assignment I did with other 3 teammate when I was studying bachelor of science in managenment mathematics with computing at Tun Abdul Rahman University College. This assignment is do a ticket ordering system program for particular cinema named TARCinemax and this assignment is code by Java.

### Module
This assignment contain 14 module which are Driver Program, Booking, Schedule, Sales Report, Movie, MovieList, Person, Payment, Cash, CreditCard, Ticket, Staff, Seat and Customer

### Features
This ticketing ordering system we built is purposely used to book tickets or order tickets in the cinema. This ticketing ordering system is controlled by the cinema staff. Customers can choose the movie with its schedule, the quantity of ticket for adult and child they want to book, choose the available seats with the aid of a diagram and also choose their payment method by cash or credit card. Once the payment is done, the ticket(s) will be printed out to the customer. For the staff login, staff can login to see all the movies showing now and other movie details such as its synopsis, duration, the movie type, director and so on. Besides that, staff also can view the sales report which contains each booking details with customer name, handphone number, the quantity of ticket they bought and the amount they have spent. Last but not least, the sales report also shows the number of bookings and the total sales amount for all bookings. The system also included exception handling to handle the error inputs key in by the user to make sure the system did not hang or stop if the user key in some unavailable or unrelated input. The system will display some text if the user key in the incorrect input and prompt the user to key in again. The system also provided the choice to exit the program if the user no longer needed to use the system to order tickets.
